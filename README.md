In this project, I, in collaboration with Sarah Finlayson, quantified
the Cu LC50 levels of 2 strains of Daphnia and conducted a microcosm experiment
designed to evaluate the effects of intra-specific diversity on population
dynamics.

##ABSTRACT
>Metal contamination is known to have a negative impact on aquatic communities and their levels of genetic diversity. For this reason, it
>is vital to develop an understanding of the sensitivities to various metal compounds exhibited by basal aquatic invertebrates, such as
>Daphnia. D. pulex and pulicaria remain understudied relative to D. magna, which is a less ecologically representative model species.
>Therefore, we employed 48-hr toxicity assays to assess how these two species vary geographically as well as inter-clonally in their
>tolerance to copper contamination. Given the known role of metal contamination in eroding genetic diversity in natural populations, we
>also ran a month long microcosm experiment to investigate how differing levels of intra-specific diversity may impact Daphnia population
>dynamics. We found statistically significant differences between D. pulex (pond) and pulicaria (lake) clonal lines in their LC50 copper
>tolerance levels (p = 0.003), but no overall geographic differences were found. In general, clonal lines did not exhibit much variation in
>their responses to copper and were all quite likely to experience significant mortality within a very narrow range of copper
>concentration. Finally, in contradiction to other studies, our microcosm experiment suggested that increasing levels of genetic diversity
>reduced population stability (as measured by a coefficient of variation) (p = 0.0471) and also had no effect on population growth rates.
>We conclude by offering suggestions for methodological improvements to the experiments performed herein.
